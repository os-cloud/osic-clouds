# OSIC User Tools
Join **#osic-clouds** on Freenode IRC to get access to your Community Managers and other OSIC Community Members to help each other with your projects and cluster usage troubleshooting.

Find helpful tools and more at [https://github.com/osic/osic-clouds](https://github.com/osic/osic-clouds "GitHub Repo for OSIC-Clouds")

Don't have your own multi-node and cloud deployment method? You are welcome to use the same tool that we have developed to re-base the environments for handing off to the next user. This set of instructions and scripts is NOT a supported tool with any kind of SLA; it is merely provided as a good faith use tool.

# Getting Started
Before one may even use the OSIC clouds, they would need to apply for access and submit the reasoning for their access request. Start by following this link and filling out the form provided. See: [https://osic.org/clusters](https://osic.org/clusters)

The OSIC Clusters submission form entries are automagically sent to the OSIC-Cluster Team's inbox early morning each Monday. These are then entered for review by the OSIC Governance Board. The OSIC Governance Board meets remotely every other Friday. So, an entry submitted on a Saturday has a chance to sit for almost two weeks before it is reviewed.
